README

The code I have used for visualization
No shell script made (what's the point of automating this right now).
But the general idea is
-Process the data by suburb: run AddingData.py
-Map tweets by suburbs: run MappingTweets.py
-Visualize on google maps: Choropleth.html

   AddingData
To be used for integrating suburb data into a suburb file.
Currently creates an empty suburbs json {EmptySuburbs} to place the data into, but this code can be used as a template 
for adding data into a non-empty json suburb 'masterfile'
Currently, it goes through SuburbWorkingAgeEmploymentByIncome dataset and records each suburb's data into an output json {suburbOutput}, a json file of VIC suburbs now with the working age data included.

   MappingTweets
Goes through a tweet file, in this case TinyTwitter.json, and
counts each tweet, and stores this count as a property within
an output {suburbOutputWithTweets}
I used TinyTwitter because our tweets don't have newlines between them; ie. not Json (min) format
Currently written to have MPI capabilities (but I have not tested)
NOTE: MappingTweets saves all the streamed-in twitter data in a local 'data' variable. For large files, we will have to add an extra loop in the code, limiting how much data to stream into local memory before processing.

<<<<<HTML/JS Files>>>>>
   Choropleth
Visualizes a specified json as a choropleth (currently suburb output with tweets) based off some property (numTweets in this case) via the Google Maps API
Currently very basic, and code must be changed manually if we wish to visualize a different json and/or different properties; no front-end control as yet
Must be opened in Firefox, chrome security settings do not allow downloading from local host to the google maps api.

<<<<<JSON files>>>>>
   SuburbWorkingAgeEmploymentByIncome
VIC gov dataset

   TinyTwitter
Assignment 1, 1000 tweets (?almost? all with geo)

   Suburbs
VIC gov PSMA suburb dataset (coords dictating boundaries + names)

   SuburbsExtended
A scaled-down version of suburbs (Melbourne as opposed to VIC)

   SuburbOutputDONOTALTER
The empty suburb file with data from SuburbWorkingAgeEmploymentByIncome added in

   suburbOutputWithTweets
The empty suburb file with tweet counts obtained from TinyTwitter
