this look its the look of fear while at the vets siamese siamesecat catsofinstagram cats
okay so this edsheeranisoverparty is cracking me up ed didnt specify any particular artist the only fan base to jump to conclusions
is the gaga fan base if they are the only group to get offended you dont see the bey hive or katycats jumping up and down
in theory because the monsters are offended it could mean that she actually did do it to stay relevant
either way its hilarious how quickly people jump on artists
also gagametallica was horrible
righteo good to know thanks for the info

point being the really couldnt give a fuck what you say have a lovely day
there are children at logan why you know its extremely violent right
tell me to shut up you engaged me in a tradh talk conversation and your having a go hahah oh people amuse me

can you get a life
haha come back to me when you can put together a decent informed argument
you came here i tweeted openly then you start throwing knives like a child
pot kettle black oh this is cracking me up
right because threats and violence is the answer must be a trump voter
and thats your opinion im not telling you not to you just have no reason to go waving your hate in my face
and i hope it makes you feel wonderful have a nice day
some people clearly have nothing better to do than find people to fight with online its actually hilarious

he still loves me even though ive brought him to the vet for a check up monash veterinary clinic

why is sexuality news who cares about that whats wrong with just talking about his amazing career homophobic media
thats what should happen
dodgy ankles having treatment for couple months osteo dryneedling ultrasound nothing is working sore to walk
if saad saints can get 2 years im guessing that means bombers will be no longer an aflteam yes
she just says its hurts to walk she plays a lot of netball but there is no swelling etc confused
unless ur in a position where you can share ur sexuality story y question him as 2 when he comes out homophobic not ur business
