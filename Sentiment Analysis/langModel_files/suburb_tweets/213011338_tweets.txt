the wired ds2 controller is kind of a bummer though a product from a different time
interesting there are dongles that can apparently convert the ps2s output to hdmi and if i plug that into my xbox ones hdmi in
i only plan on playing persona on it anyway and its not that much of a twitchbased but is it worth the effort probably not
bonus assassins creed rogue this time tried out xbox one streaming in my room router position not ideal but i got an okay experience
but where was yes rogue is basically a smaller black flag but with improvements which is fully welcome because i loved black flag
unlocked frame rates is even better though wonky wifi masked that but i would have loved a resolution boost somehow
also did you know the nintendo nes classic is in stock at ebgames and it hasnt sold out yet amazing right
ac rogue is kind of an amalgamation of all the previous ac games and i think thats kind of great
notably stalkers from revelations are back and the city expansion stuff from brotherhoodrevelations is here too
and as ive mentioned already the improvements to the black flag formula are very welcome there are a bunch of neat additions too
from a gameplay perspective being a templar sure familiar
love kome we love rice ep2 for crossdressing clockwork planet ep2 shifting gears
okay now this was a little better doesnt make it good but its enough to make me not think its garbage and possibly continue watching
still one more left to watch for today yes five 4 and a quarter shows in a day but i have to make exceptions for pripara
idol time pripara ep2 prison break the divine idol returns
i like that shes there but i think for idol time pripara to really come into its own they need to get her out of there
as much as i want more of the old cast i think it would be best that they at best be cameo appearances unless its leona or sophie
dont get me wrong im enjoying this almost as much as i do the original series but i just have concerns about the existence of boypara
like it would have made sense if this were an alternate universe but that theyve gone on this long without acknowledging it is weird
pripara is apparently a global sensation yet this one town just happens to be into boy idols
today in persona 3 operation babe hunt a little disappointed that summer break is here though i wanted to do more social
ive almost completely maxed out all my social stats though just one more academics and courage level i will be a god
theoretically i should be able to stream ps2 to my xbox one to my pc in my room clunky i know also there will be latency
bayonetta pc whaaaaaaaaa
tomorrows vidya persona 3 and assassins creed rogue bring on midsemester break
i really do begin to wonder if development teams in japan have their own separate team just for boob quality
lala must die that is all
i still just have p4au and metal gear rising revengeance on my wish list for xb1 bc pleaseee
new nintendo direct at 8am tomorrow guess im up for that
little witch academia ep14 futureproof occupy luna nova
yokai watch ep68 this story is a work of fiction bad smelz
shokugeki no souma will be finished tomorrow guess ill be continuing gekkan shoujo nozakikun right after
greg pls
i just opened kissanime and the random anime suggestion was a to love ru darkness ova fuck
gimme 50 whole pixel
jojo stardust crusaders ep12 the pains of letting go better luck next time polnareff
shokugeki no souma s2e13 legacy
done same rules apply to the first season fun show ups the ante a little the majority of the season is just one event though
shokugeki no souma s2 810 add points if you like the concept of people having orgasms while eating food
tsuki ga kirei ep2 move me
mamudo no problem
today in persona 3 exams also 50 hours of tartarus grinding
jojo stardust crusaders ep7 ship happens shokugeki no souma s2e8 feel fish smell fish taste be fish
i think these things only come to mind because of that association with video game styles but yes i approve of this show
maybe itll be like the young satoru parts of boku dake ga inai machi without people dying because that would be nice
also boy idols im not sure how this affects the existence of leona and hibiki however seeing as their appearances suggest otherwise
and so far the presence of lala feels like shes some kind of tutorial giver its nice to have her here why is she here
i still think about pripara like 50 times a day
my hero academia s2e15 oh boy i love deathrun maps
tsuki ga kirei ep1 23 minutes of awkward staring idol time pripara ep1 brand new dreamer
the artstyle reminds me a lot of celshaded graphics in videogames and the animations of the extras are a little robotlike but its fine
i like yumekawa yui shes totally spaced out and very cute and her rice cooker cooky is too precious
i get the weird feeling that the paparajuku pripara feels like a mobile game especially with the idol time system
the nature of priparas mysterious system entity is still a source of much intrigue for me
of course all my love is for the original series and solami smile and dressing pafe and all the rest but i need
i can see it now f2p mobile pripara management sim build your own pripara attract all the idols spend your hard earned cash on pribucks
do you guys remember when i used to talk about things like videogames and tech my sad life because its just pripara and anime now
firstly rip wii u killed off before even the 3ds secondly what do they even have to say about the 3ds at this point
i guess theres the impending release of fe echoes and fe warriors and then ever oasis and pikmin whenever that will
catherine on xbox 360 xb1 compatible is for xbox live gold subscribers mine
now if only there was enough time during the day to keep up with all of my social especially the sunday only ones eugh
standing in the hall at lunchtime and watching the lines of people coming to tell me to hang out with them after school is stressful
yowamushi pedal new generation ep14 great expectations
jojo stardust crusaders ep11 kill the light shokugeki no souma s2e12 a crash course in french
i love this game but the not so much socialising flies by in about 15 minutes and then you grind for another
tsuki ga kirei is looking to be one of those coming of age stories which im down for sit back and enjoy this one because i recommend it
and the other show idol time pripara needs no explaining if anything i would still recommend you watch the original if you havent
renaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
gtnintendo switch and nintendo 3ds gtfocused on arms and splatoon
just give me an au inazuma eleven go chrono stone release and ill be happy thanks
and i still havent even finished fates
also receiving calls at night to hang out on sunday ive learnt my lesson about double booking thank you very much
tomorrows vidya persona 3
well okay i still talk about those things barring the last one im too boring to talk about myself really
todays vidya the tartarus grind continues im actually up to date in that regard now theres just grinding until the next full moon
power went out five times in the space of 10 minutes this surge protection is ridiculous
so belfiore is back is this the messianic figure windows phone fans have been waiting for who knows
i want to keep playing persona 34 on my ps2 just because i have the actual games beyond maybe ill emulate
might just consider getting the hd remaster on vita instead if the price is right gladiator will be emulated i think
itadakimasu
granted emulation isnt perfect either ive run into glitches and framerate issues playing the original ratchet and clank in such a way
your relationship with chihiro has reached the next level ohhh shiiiiiiiit we gettin some anime booty tonight
i also thought about kingdom hearts 12 but might just grab the hd collection on ps4 when it strikes my fancy
all of this probably isnt going to happen until the end of the year so yeah time management
i guess ive considered the notion of emulating future ps2 games on my surface but i just like the feel of actual hardware
speaking of which actively considering playing through the original ratchet and clank trilogy sometime after im done with persona 4
what i do believe is with panos panay leading hardware and belfiore leading windows 10 we can only be expecting great things
livin like an on those movies i see doing my laundry in a laundry mat
brodiejamesdriverimke chips time bell st pizza
gt might come back to it later not what im feeling like right now if anything it makes me want to go play battlefield 1 lol
