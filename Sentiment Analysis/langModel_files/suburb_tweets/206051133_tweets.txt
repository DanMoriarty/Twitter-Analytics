waiting for to come home
i feel the author of that page is being far too harsh to those culinary delights
oh thats good i guess
there was supposed to be a photo with that last tweet
i love paul keatings cultural cringe question time speech
that does sound pretty rude
the food is more attractive
you can see the gclr
after throwing billions of dollars to the states nsa
this feels like cultural appropriation
i reckon they are going to phase out kaching
even though apparently my apartment is so below market rate according to the real estate agent
morning
can you put the chocolate away so it doesnt look like ive eaten it all me but you have eaten it all
ive only ever got to go to sydney or shudder adelaide
sounds good

i like the sound of that
im not the messiah
im just a naughty boy
yeah ill probably just be sore tomorrow
it was great
oh dear ive only got 13 bottles of wine left
true true

marge someone broke the toilet
what about nandos
oh thats alright then
then i guess its just android playing catchup then p
oh that sounds interesting
have you seen my stapler
omg but i was just about to go for a walk
yay
i fell down the stairs
they were wet and slippery from the rain and i slid down them
that isnt saying much is it
its not as good as motorway patrol though
its a new episode too
the ads said it was new but maybe they lied
ive already used 146gb in about 3 months of having my macbook
ive got a 512gb 13 inch retina
yeah it seems odd that no trams were coming considering how close you were to the depot
ah
its because he gets so easily distracted by shiny homosexual things
im so tired i should do that thing that you are supposed to do when you are
to be fair it wouldnt have been 830 a few days ago
get it out for the boys
sounds like a rort
lol
i used the email address that gave me if thats not correct you should give me one that works
95

awesome what kind of job
more shopping
you missed out man
good morning lukeland

my whole team at work is currently addicted to the real cookie clicker click click click
dont ever change leemilton
i seem to have prepared myself a very odd dinner gorgonzola stale bread pickled chillies and red wine
happy birthday
you need a few hours to properly look at everything more if you want to line up and go into the dark room
they have made recreations of a dining room and a living room where the things in the room are made from cake and icing
i would expect no less
too
rbt is on
haha ill have to track it down
is your apartment on the market
wine is good
sounds good
yes
look what got me for christmas
yeah
nice crack p
just reminds me too much of work
you must have been hiding some expensive things at the bottom of your trolley
aww that sucks
a big one with bright flashing lights
haha its not very portable though
plus retina my oldman eyes need all the pixels they can get
ill take a crack at it
did you die
yeah it has a great atmosphere
good list

i really loved the icing and cake based installation by the hotham st ladies i saw today at the ngv
thats true i think ill stick to the continental version for now though
cool
you should
saaaa cute i want i want puppy puppylove pupstagram petstagram instapet instapup bartolo

exhausting on account of all the christmas shopping
i think ive discovered the secret to cooking red wine lots of red wine

im pretty good how are you
thats such an easy mistake to make
labor
if you want you may have to occasionally avert your eyes
they now fly with two fire extinguishers on board
yeah the airs are really portable and last ages on the battery but i really wanted the retina display
i think we stumbled upon that the other night
yes it is
typically shitty unrenovated ones
oh right
so that was fun cooking pork on the bbq lots of fire
i just poked my eye with the corner of a tissue i didnt even realise that was possible
sure
its the jam and bread that gets you
why do they insist on doing that
time to stock up for this once a year event save up to 75 at the huge 2xu yearly
