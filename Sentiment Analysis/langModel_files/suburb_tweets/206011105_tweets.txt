yo ive listened to nice guys who evidently think theyre being sneaky and nontransparent neg my bf for seven years
it is prob time i stepped it up from frames tho 16 years of abuse
only brought over about five books i was leaving behind tiny things like necklaces and paintbrushes bc not enough

oh also its my birthday yes thank you i am a woman at last
is the ultimate straight womans fantasy a man in a nice jumper or blazer with a cat on his shoulder looking into camera

shoutout to people endlessly sharing that avril lavigne clickhole quote as if its real exciting 2 see how stupid you think women are
this is my best tweet
but then i discovered he always had the lyrics to eye of the tiger open on his ipad every single day that i worked for him
so imagine my disturbancejoy when i found this the other day
i sincerely hope u guys are ready for me to smell like a quixotic quivering bouquet at all times
they r an absolute waste of a perfectly good plateau phase

nope turns out hes just sexy and welldressed and painstakingly kind and thoughtful stick that in your elasticwaisted cargo pants
i love nin but i reckon listening to those lyrics for the first time as an adult could be an exercise in nostril flaring
just saw silence of the lambs for the first time and let me tell its a hit
these are some great tweets drew

richard looks strangely great in a robe jess is a brat but hes too beautiful not to make my four im so ashamed
god im such a betty
i would wear 100 of that bottom centre outfit even after everyone made fun of my hat
cool cool ill keep em guessing
what if the image map is just the word geocities and if you click the o it takes you to google tho
i carefully trim sheet of expensive watercolour paper amp lay it on my desk amp 2 seconds later here comes this asshole
why r ppl photoshopping things onto the queen when that outfit is fucking sick as is
these are really good
how 2 convey 2 strangers that im highly strung but great at house parties
as a practitioner of the female gaze im finding commentary on the tweet below fascinating
certain things like shitty thin jersey fabrics and badly designed elastic waistlines are eternally miserable

omg i dont think i have ever successfully flirted in my life certainly not w anyone i was actually attracted to impossible
i can toss my hair and laugh w boring ppl all day but the instant i think someone is sexy i start blushing try to leave
