30 up against a decent eredivisie side before half time surely the championship title is a formality
cant wait for that last tweet to be rtd a thousand times when were relegated to league one
wow
this is my new favourite headline ever
fucking hell man
disgusting was overproduced just as much it was musically more aggressive but production wasnt that different
sick on the other hand was raw as fuck
musically raw but not production wise
this court case is getting weirder
hell stay
my ears ringing from being as an ocean
look what just appeared in australia love this album
i keep forgetting to attach pictures to tweets
had some amazing experiences and met some incredible people in that time hopefully that continues
sick of having to read match updates on here cant wait to be able to actually watch the games again nufc
i cant wait for nobody to buy moussa sissoko should give our u23 team quite a boost if he stays
that sounds incredibly dodgy at best
siren song of the counter culture and american idiot came out in the same year idk why but i find that weird
fucking epl adverts everywhere all week but nobody in australia wants to show us playing in the championship
bet you cant play it live though frauds
why would i want to buy carling over here why would i want to buy it anywhere for that matter
you that old
aye i know that still though be interesting to see how he does there
a year ago today i landed in melbourne a whole year feels like yesterday
aarons off instead of anita i want to trust rafa but really

wheres this statement nufc
interesting loan move
15km trail merri creek trail in clifton hill victoria
here man what happened to that six game unbeaten run we had at the end of last season i want that back nufc
awesome news always knew this guy would end up back here
a good honest statement imo not much more he can say at this stage
11 and a half hour shift at work today ready for some beers and a toon win nufc
penalty tho yes
ahahahahhaha hes actually starting riviere ahead of mitrovic and doumbia
the bloke has to be sacked
mitrovic for all the criticism still has five times as many goals as riviere in the league

i love joey but this belongs on riamverysmart
looks incredible i miss st james park
because who doesnt love a creepy old man
our local cinema is gorgeous so much swoon palace cinemas westgarth
savage
unpresidented thats one of those best words he was banging on about i guess
genuinely dont want him to play for us again if he is racist
genuinely find it incredibly disturbing how many people dont give a fuck if hes racist to be perfectly honest
rather we missed out on promotion than played a racist for the rest of the season
again id love to be proven wrong but at this point that seems very unlikely
i hope he gets sacked if its really true
is this what i have to look forward to for christmas this year give me strength
not at all

saturday morning merri creek trail
always maintained we have several better options than hart no idea how he keeps his place
his debut that pass to janmaat for the first goal was incredible so much potential
codeine is awesome though
bed time knackered
aye i know that still surprised he went down to the championship
if youre gonna pull a gun might as well ask for all the nuggets
i do not miss that train station
is it sad to go to a club night on your own asking for a mate
i i mean my mate wouldnt bother but deez nuts are doing a live set which could be fun
the tories are fucking scum

i swear most football fans on twitter are actually troll accounts
i realised long ago i just chose to ignore it
thats a lie i dont care enough to check your bio regularly
how the fuck is it bad to agree with a former party leader on something
are you suggesting that the party should undergo a complete 180 every time a new leader comes in
thats insane
dont have a choice its an obligation to buy
jesus christ get over yourselves

rafa is clearly involved in transfers if weve not got anyone at the end of the window im sure its because hes agreed its not worth it
if anyone would like to give me a job id be grateful so grateful id agree to do work in exchange for a wage
the music games are shite but theyve got a special place in my heart
imagine thinking that punching this guy wasnt a good thing
fuck altright nazi cunts
much ado about nothing
im seeing the term altleft appear more and more now particularly among right wing folk what the fuck is the altleft
that hazard goal isnt bad but its really not as good as people are saying
very young for a captain taking him out of the firing line probably a good thing
im now a notts county fan
dont think hes done much wrong personally barely even had a chance to do so
so are absolute legends
this clubs fans are terrible
im honestly amazed people are finding a way to make this negative
any idea what the fee is
wow
why the fuck should we use public money to fund commercial space travel
i think i might have it but im not sure

forgot to post this yesterday got some awesome new northlane vinyl
perez is useless as a lone striker
about time mitrovic came on
seems a bit expensive but fuck it hope he does well
nexus easy
that suspension is the last fucking thing we need just let him score weve lost anyway
shame too because lascelles had done well
lallana is shit
so is henderson
becharnett buying her potions for the witching nah just some hippy smelly stuff smells like a
barlaser can play right back too suspect thats why hes on the bench covers more positions were fine for attackers
id imagine so
