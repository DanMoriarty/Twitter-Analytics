the dream pass on floor front lay full twist punch double front half tucked floor gymnastics
the beauty of training when the junior gymnasts are around is you can use them as a weight matthew
double arabian stretched my first f tumbling pass on floor cant wait to compete it gymnast
liam amp i putting in the work at training strength gainz gymnastics gymnast
my strength training partner and i just finished a weight session its great to work
so ive started the tough gruelling process of trying to upgrade my floor routine and this is the
not quite there yet but hey its an upgrade with worlds trial just around the corner id love for
i decided today that im going back to basics and utilising the spring board where you only allowed
sums up a lot about how i am and how i think ive been doing gymnastics for 16 years and havent had
got so much respect for and manriquelarduet to do this ridiculously hard dismount off
so its not quite high enough but if you asked me before if i would ever be able to do maltese on
this was my last saturday training session before my injury but as you can see i was enjoying every
so one of my gymnasts got me a gymnastics themed nanoblocks set as a get well present during my
so this feels really awesome usually people would prefer to be on their feet but after 4 weeks
we did it boys to celebrate 1000 awesome people following me on my instagram page here is me
just posted a photo greville st park
so its been 5 weeks since my achilles reattachment surgery and im glad to let you know that im
week 7 post surgery and although theyre not the best giants i can do on rings im really pumped
swinging on that high bar again even threw a yamawaki in there as well gymnastics
ps headphone users beware noise halfway through might destroy your ears and ruin your life
repost nursebron with repostapp state squad training high performance centre this is
more to come on high bar while i start to make my way back into some training but for now im
after 4 agonising long months since i ruptured my achilles tendon i can finally start to push a
four months post surgery saw mr otis wang and he is really with my achilles feels so good to
even though im retired doesnt mean you cant still have a bit of fun in the gym before you
comeback season is 2k17 kentpieterse gymnastics gymnasticsaustralia backatitagain
this top notch guy is always around to help me through tough times especially during strength

you could say i got an extra bit of spring in my step a bit over 8 months since i ruptured my
kovacs after doing this amazing sport for 17 years i can finally say im part of the kovacs
ever wondered what its like being a gymnast and doing a flip and seeing what we see here i am
first tumbling session backwards on floor since i ruptured my achilles 12 months ago fair to
first time doing a live landing off high bar in 14 months probably the biggest hurdle to
trying a new vault and cleaning up some of my passes on the tumble track in preparation for the
some bits from thursdays training session first comp is next week at home hpc then onto
so had a bet with greg coachmentorboss tonight to see whether i could do a double arabian
a great tumbling session from last week before i tweaked my ruptured achilles a bit hopefully
really happy to have this pass back in my floor routine for trial 2 this sunday at
decided to go back to basics at yesterdays training still got a bit of work to do but overall
with one month to go till national championships its time to start pushing the
